Hi! Thanks for downloading my map!

Installation:

Inside the folder "Server Resource" there is the "map" folder. Add this to your server in the "resources" folder.

Then, inside your server.cfg, add "start map" to start the resource.

Now, restart your server and enjoy! (This map is now entirely server sided, no client-side modification needed!)

If you have any suggestions please reach out on the forum!

!! LIEN !!
